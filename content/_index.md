### What is Lity

Lity is a new programming language for building blockchain smart contracts. It consists of a *dynamically extensible language*, a *compiler*, and a *virtual machine* on the CyberMiles blockchain. It is a superset of the Solidity language and is more extensible, performant, and safe. Specifically,

* The libENI dynamic VM extension allows native functions to be added to the virtual machine on the fly, without stopping, forking or upgrading the blockchain. 

* The ERC checker not only checks but also automagically fixes common security bugs in smart contracts.

* The new keyword `schedule` allows smart contracts to schedule timer tasks to be executed in the future, which is required by many real-world business contracts such as trust, will, installment payments, insurance, stock options, and investment returns.

* The upcoming Lity Rules Engine allows formal business rules to be embedded in smart contracts. That could drastically increase developer productivity and reduce errors.

The name Lity pays homeage to to Solidity, and inspires to be more flexible / expansible (liquid) and more performant (combustable) at the same time. Lity is developed by the [CyberMiles Foundation](https://www.cybermiles.io/) in collaboration with [Skymizer](https://skymizer.com/), and is released under GPL as Free Software. All rights reserved.
