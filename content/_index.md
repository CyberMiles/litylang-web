### What is Lity

Lity is a new programming language for building blockchain smart contracts. It consists of a *dynamically extensible language*, a *compiler*, and a *virtual machine* on the CyberMiles blockchain. It is a superset of the Solidity language and is more extensible, performant, and safe.

The name Lity pays homeage to to Solidity, and inspires to be more flexible / expansible (liquid) and more performant (combustable) at the same time. Lity is developed by the [CyberMiles Foundation](https://www.cybermiles.io/) in collaboration with the [Skymizer](https://skymizer.com/), and is released under GPL as Free Software.
