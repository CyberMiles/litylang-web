# Business Rules

According to the [CyberMiles whitepaper](https://www.cybermiles.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Technical-Whitepaper_en-US.pdf), one of the key features of the CyberMiles
platform is to incorporate a business rules engine directly into the 
virtual machine. The Lity language specification for rules engine support
is [available here](http://lity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/files/lity-rule-engine-spec-v1-0.pdf).
